# neolink-docker

This project intents to create docker images for common unix platforms (ARMV6, ARMV7, ARM64, 386 and AMD64) which contain the built binaries from the master branch of the thirtythreeforty/neolink github repository.

Docker images are regenerated every weeks and available here https://hub.docker.com/r/r3aper/neolink.
